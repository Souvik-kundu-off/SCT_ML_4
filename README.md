# Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to build a **Hand Gesture Recognition model** that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hand gesture recognition is an exciting area of computer vision that allows more natural interaction between humans and computers.  
In this project, I developed a **deep learning-based classification model** to recognize hand gestures using the **Hand Gesture Dataset**.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and resized gesture images  
   - Normalized pixel values  
   - Converted categorical labels into numerical form  

2. **Model Building**
   - Used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction  
   - Applied dropout and regularization to prevent overfitting  
   - Compiled the model with categorical cross-entropy loss  

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained the CNN on the gesture dataset  
   - Used data augmentation for better generalization  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Checked accuracy and loss curves  
   - Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report  

5. **Visualization**
   - Displayed predictions on sample images  
   - Highlighted correctly and incorrectly classified gestures

## 📈 Results

- The hand gesture recognition model successfully classified different gestures.  
- Achieved high accuracy on the validation set.  
- Demonstrated potential for real-world human-computer interaction applications.
